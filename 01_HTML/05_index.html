    <!-- Semantic tags : 

### 1. Improved Accessibility
**What it means:** Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on semantic tags to provide context to visually impaired users.

**How it helps:**
- Tags like `<nav>` indicate navigation menus.
- `<main>` tells assistive devices the main content area of the page.

This ensures that users with disabilities can interact with your website effectively.


### 2. Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
**What it means:** Search engines use semantic tags to understand your content.

**How it helps:**
- Tags like `<article>` and `<section>` help search engines identify the structure of your content, improving visibility.
- `<header>` and `<footer>` clearly separate the beginning and end of the content.

This makes your page more likely to rank higher in search results.


### 3. Code Readability and Maintenance
**What it means:** Semantic tags make your code easier to read and maintain.

**How it helps:**
- `<header>` is more descriptive than `<div class="header">`.
- Developers can quickly understand the structure and purpose of each section.

Future modifications or team collaborations become smoother.


### 4. Standardization
**What it means:** Semantic HTML aligns your code with W3C standards.

**How it helps:**
- Following standards ensures your site behaves consistently across different browsers.
- It makes your website future-proof as web technologies evolve.
     
### 5. Enhanced User Experience
**What it means:** Users intuitively interact with well-structured websites.

**How it helps:**
- Clear content organization makes navigation intuitive.
- A consistent layout improves the overall user journey.


### 6. Easier Debugging
**What it means:** Semantic tags create a logical structure for debugging.

**How it helps:**
- When inspecting the DOM, elements like `<nav>` or `<aside>` are easier to locate than generic `<div>` or `<span>` elements.
- Logical groupings reduce confusion when troubleshooting layout or behavior issues.
